# Branding the login screen

The standard Umbraco login screen looks the same for every site, so to make it easier for editors to spot the difference when they work on multiple Umbraco sites, we change the background image and text of the login screen. This is done by `~\App_Plugins\Escc.UmbracoBranding\branding-v2.css`, which is enabled by `package.manifest` in the same folder.
