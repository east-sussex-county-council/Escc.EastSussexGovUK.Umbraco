/* Bibliographic Services want to print entries from the Umbraco Forms entries viewer to use as a warehouse 
   picking note. This CSS hides elements of the Umbraco back-office UI that overlap the data, and ensures the 
   data prints correctly across multiple pages. 

   It affects the whole back-office as it's not possible to isolate the entries viewer.
   However, there is no other apparent use case for printing from the back-office, and it doesn't
   look as if it's designed for it anyway as the overlapping happens everywhere, and this improves it.
